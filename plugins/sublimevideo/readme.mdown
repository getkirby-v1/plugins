# SublimeVideo
	
## What is it?

This plugin is a Kirbytext extension, in order to easily use the [SublimeVideo HTML5 Player](http://sublimevideo.net/). It provides you with a new tag:

	(sublime: video-name width: xxx height: yyy)

## Installation

1. Copy the `sublimevideo.php` file into your `site/plugins` folder. If the plugins folder doesn't exist yet, please create it. As a plugin, the file will be automatically loaded by Kirby.

2. Put your SublimeVideo embed code inside the `<head>` tag of your site. It should look like this :

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/YOUR_TOKEN.js"></script>
```

Please note that you need to have a [SublimeVideo account](http://sublimevideo.net/plans) (free). This service is very easy to use but if you need help, please refer to [their documentation](http://docs.sublimevideo.net/quickstart-guide). I am also not going to discuss [video encoding](http://docs.sublimevideo.net/encode-videos-for-the-web) here.

## How to use it?

This tag will load all video files and an image poster file from the current page folder, which match the video-name value. Here's a list of example files:

- myvideo.hd.mp4
- myvideo.hd.ogv
- myvideo.hd.webm
- myvideo.mobile.mp4
- myvideo.mobile.ogv
- myvideo.mobile.webm
- myvideo.poster.png
- myvideo.standard.mp4
- myvideo.standard.ogv

Use the tag…

	(sublime: myvideo width: 400 height: 300)

…in your text to automatically load the SublimeVideo with all matching files. 

Adding `.hd` and `.standard` to files with the same extension will mark files as HD and low-res video files and will enable [SublimeVideo HD switching](http://docs.sublimevideo.net/hd-switching) You can also add the `.mobile` prefix to specify a file, which will be used on mobile devices. 

If you add an additional image file with the same naming convention (i.e. `myvideo.poster.png`) this file will be used as a preview as long as the video has not been loaded yet and if video playback is not available. 

### Attributes

- `sublime`: the files common name
- `width`: the width of the video 
- `height`: the height of the video
- `uid`: a unique id (optional), which will appear in the [SublimeVideo stats](http://docs.sublimevideo.net/optimize-for-stats)
- `name`: the name of the video (optional), which will appear in the [SublimeVideo stats](http://docs.sublimevideo.net/optimize-for-stats)
- `class`: an additional class name, which will be added to the video tag. SublimeVideo tags already have a sublime class by default, but you can use this optionally to add another class. 

### Full Example

	(sublime: myvideo width: 540 height: 304 name: My awesome video uid: myvideo class: myvideo)

## Shortcut

If you need to embed SublimeVideos directly in your template or snippet files you can use the available shortcut function:

```php

<?php echo sublime('myvideo', 300, 400) ?>

```
