## What is Kirby?

Kirby is a file-based cms. Easy to setup, easy to use, flexible as hell. You can find more about it here: <http://getkirby.com>

## What are Kirby extensions

This is a repository of snippets, plugins, templates, predefined site structures, etc. for Kirby. Anyone is invited to add their own or help me improve mine. 

## Some simple rules for your own extensions

Pleas put all the files for your snippets or templates or whatever in a folder and add a simple markdown file with some explanations about that piece of code and how to use it. Just download one of mine and use that as a template if you want.
