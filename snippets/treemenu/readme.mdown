# Treemenu Snippet

## What is it?

a very simple tree menu snippet, which renders a menu of all your site's pages and subpages

## Installation 

Put the treemenu.php file in your site/snippets folder

## How to use it?

    <?php snippet('treemenu') ?>

## Customization

Change the html in site/snippets/treemenu.php to get the best results for your project
	    
## Start with a sublevel

If you don't want it to start from the first level
give it a set of pages, where it should start. i.e.:

	<? 
  
	// get the first set of subpages which should be used
	$subpages = $pages->find('about-us')->children();
  
	// create the snippet beginning with those subpages
	snippet('treemenu', array('subpages' => $subpages));
  
	?>
